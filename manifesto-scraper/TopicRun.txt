First, I ran CorEx, a semi-supervised learning technique. This works similarly to LDA, but allows the usage of anchor words, to help
guide the model. I did the first run without anchor words, to see what unsupervised topics would be generated:

Topic #1: pledge, accessible, powerful, poverty inequality, policies, points, playing field, powers, plastic, petrol diesel
Topic #2: ability, policing, politics, poor, poorest, practice, premium, prioritise, prison, processes
Topic #3: abroad, preventing, pregnant, powerhouse, policy, playing, play, priorities, platforms, petrol
Topic #4: accept, pounds, ports, political parties, political, police force, places, perpetrators, per cent, people face
Topic #5: academic, police forces, politically, positive, preserve, prices, prioritising, private investment, privatisation, privatisation nhs
Topic #6: abolish, principles, primates, prevent, pressure, prepared, practices, postbrexit, possession, plastic waste
Topic #7: abolishing, products, profits, project, proportional, provides, public transport, publication, published, purpose
Topic #8: abusers, pfi, planet, planning system, politicians, post, power, precious, prepare, prevention
Topic #9: able, rate, racism, pubs, provide support, protection, protect, received, property, projects
Topic #10: across uk, present, prescription, pregnancy, practical, population, pollution, pressing, planned, places worship


I then went through these words and discarded ambiguous words (i.e. 'play', 'prepare'). I've put these discarded words into their
own anchor, so that irrelevant words join that topic (a filtering topic, to purify the other topics). The topics looked as such after
filtering:

Topic #1: poverty inequality, playing field, plastic, petrol diesel
Topic #2: policing, poor, poorest, prison
Topic #3: powerhouse, petrol
Topic #4: pounds, police force, perpetrators
Topic #5: academic, police forces, private investment, privatisation, privatisation nhs
Topic #6: postbrexit, plastic waste
Topic #7: public transport
Topic #8: abusers, planet
Topic #9: racism
Topic #10: pollution, places worship

Then, I attempted to categorise the remaining words into political topics (i.e. brexit, climate change, crime, etc.) 
This involved moving some words/bigrams around, and shortening the amount of topics:

Topic #1 (Poverty/Income Equality): poverty inequality, playing field, poor, poorest
Topic #2 (Policing/Crime): policing, prison, police force, perpetrators, racism, police forces, places worship, abusers
Topic #3 (Economy): powerhouse, pounds, privatisation, private investment
Topic #4 (Education/Schooling): academic
Topic #5 (NHS/Healthcare): privatisation, privatisation nhs
Topic #6 (Brexit): postbrexit, 
Topic #7 (Environment/Climate Change): planet, plastic, petrol diesel, plastic waste, pollution, petrol, public transport

I'll use these words as my anchors, along with some words from my intuition (i.e. 'brexit' for the brexit topic, 'climate change' 
for the environment/climate change topic, etc.)

The complete list of anchors at this stage are as follows:
