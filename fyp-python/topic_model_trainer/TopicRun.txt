I am using CorEx (Correlation Explanation), via a semi-supervised anchoring method to model topics on 2000 articles
Firstly, I split the 2000 articles into an 90/10 train/test split, with 1800 training and 200 testing files
In terms of split over news organisations, this is as follows:
        Total: 1800 tr, 400 te
        BBC: 291 tr, 32 te
        Daily Mail: 214 tr, 24 te
        Mirror: 364 tr, 40 te
        Independent: 354 tr, 39 te
        Guardian: 534 tr, 60 te
        Telegraph: 45 tr, 5 te

Firstly, I trained the model with the 1800 articles, looking for 50 hidden latent topics
I've picked such a high number so as to find the cutoff point when topics no longer aid to the total correlation (TC)
This is the score that the CorEx model strives to maximise
I've plotted the topics over the TC:
    When more topics no longer aids the overall TC, we can say that they are less useful
    Thus, visually, I chose to cutoff the number of topics at 15
    This graph can be viewed in (figure x)

The top words for these 50 topics are as such:

As we can see, some intelligent grouping has already been done - but we can optimise this further with anchor words

I visually went through the top words from the different topics, and classed them together
This is where the semi-supervised aspect of the model comes in
CorEx has a feature of anchor words - keywords that incentivise the model to classify certain text as a given topics
For instance, one anchor could be "[jeremy corbyn, labour, corbyn, long bailey]", and would group these words, and correlating
words together - for this example, it would be for a 'Labour party' topic
This also allows me to group together junk words
    For instance, some article text has words like 'register with' and 'log in'
    By creating an anchor with these words, the junk gets grouped together
    And we can essentially ignore this topic, and ensure our meaningful topics are less cluttered/more accurate

Through a combination of combining word classes, creating a junk class, and creating my own anchor classes, these are the 15 topics:

anchors = [
    JUNK - ["facebook", "messenger", "linkedin", "whatsapp", "pinterest", "facebook messenger","messenger messenger","messenger twitter","linkedin copy","new window","email facebook","pinterest","pinterest whatsapp","link these","share this", "register with","log in","to log", "social account","inbox register","your social","your inbox","log","account or","or clickâ","iâ","ve","donâ","itâ","iâ ve", "readers click","letters click","letters theguardian","ll publish","more guardian","our print","photo youâ","have photo","guardian letters","print edition", "twitter com","pic twitter","pic","journalists"], # Junk

Next, I fitted this model 5 times, and took the model with the greatest TC, and saved it

Then, I labelled 30 test articles with the most likely topics, and tested this. The results are as follows:
    23 correctly identified
    7 incorrectly identified
    i.e. a 77.67% success rate

Whilst labelling the data, I noticed the need to add more anchor words
    For instance, the foreign policy section only discusses the US
    I added China, Canada, Australia, India, Israel, and Saudia Arabia
    I chose these countries namely due to their likelihood to be mentioned in the news
    Hopefully, these will pull in information about other countries too
Moreover, I've added a 16th (15th, not including the junk topic) topic, for Wales
The updated set of anchor words are as follows:
